# LeetCode Marathon 
To aid my coding skill and to succeed in coding interview I am working on a collection of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems.

### Goal of this repository
My goal is to help other Python developer who are studying for coding interviews to have a better reference and insight to Leet Code problems, since many of the article/blog on Leet Code problems are written in Java.
