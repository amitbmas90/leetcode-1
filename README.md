# LeetCode Marathon
To aid my coding skill and to succeed in coding interview I am working on a collection of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems.

### Goal of this repository
My goal is to help other Python developer who are studying for coding interviews to have a better reference and insight to Leet Code problems, since many of the article/blog on Leet Code problems are written in Java.

### Want to contribute?
* First fork it !
* Add problem and your solution to the appropriate classifier folder
* Submit a pull request to this main repository
* Upon review your contribution will be showing in this repo that will help many others!

## Further explainations
I have constructed a blog site to post my thought process on solving some of the problems listed below
It can be linked to **[HERE](http://hanblog.tech)**

## Clarify questions to ask at interview:

1. Array:
    * Sorted or not?
    * How many elements?
    * Element type? Int, float, double?
    * What's the range of those numbers? Positive or negative?
    * Contain duplicates or not?
    * Subsequence: adjacent or not?

2. Binary tree:
    * Binary search tree or normal binary tree?
    * Balanced or not?
    * Complete or not?
    * Has parent pointer or not?

3. Linked list:
    * Singly or doubly linked list?
    * Has duplicated nodal value or not?

4. String:
    * Need to remove white spaces? Tab and newline?
    * Only has digits? English letters? Upper or lower case?

5. Graph:
    * How many nodes and edges?
    * Directed or undirected?
    * Edges have weights? If so, what's the range?
    * Has loops? Negative sum loops?

6. Return value:
    * What should my method return?
    * If there are multiple solutions to the problem, which one should be returned?
    * If it should return multiple values, do you have any preference on what to return?
    * What should I do/return if the input is invalid / does not match the constraints?
