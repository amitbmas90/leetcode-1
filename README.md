# LeetCode Marathon
To aid my coding skill and to succeed in coding interview I am working on a collection of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems.

### Goal of this repository
My goal is to help other Python developer who are studying for coding interviews to have a better reference and insight to Leet Code problems, since many of the article/blog on Leet Code problems are written in Java.

### Want to contribute?
* First fork it !
* Add problem and your solution to the appropriate classifier folder
* Submit a pull request to this main repository
* Upon review your contribution will be showing in this repo that will help many others!
